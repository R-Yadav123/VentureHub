    <h1> Mission Statement: </h1>
    Small business owners and new entrepreneurs struggle to find a local community for networking, assistance, and vendor information. The lack of a streamlined process for these activities leads to missed opportunities for collaboration and support. There is a need for a product that simplifies these processes, fostering a robust local business community. This solution would empower small business owners and new entrepreneurs to connect, collaborate, and thrive.
